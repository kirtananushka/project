# The "Tickets" project.
The project «Cinema tickets» is a website, designed to sell tickets to cinemas via the Internet.<br>
Implemented the ability to select interface language between English and Russian.<br>
Four roles are implemented: guest, client, manager, administrator.<br>
GUEST is an unregistered user. The guest can view the content of the site: a list of films, a list of shows, write to the site administrator. The guest cannot purchase tickets.<br>
CLIENT is a registered user. He has the same features, as the guest, as well as the ability to purchase tickets.<br>
MANAGER has the same features, as a guest, as well as the ability to manage clients, add, edit, delete films and shows.<br>
ADMIN (administrator) has the same capabilities as the manager, as well as the ability to appoint managers, delete and edit them.<br>
When registering on the site, you must fill in the required fields: «Login», «Name», «Surname», «Phone number», «E-mail», «Password», «Repeat password». Login must be unique.<br>
After successful registration, an email is sent to the specified e-mail address. The user must confirm his e-mail by clicking on the link.<br>
To enter the site, the user must enter his Login and Password.<br>
If the user forgot the password, it is possible to generate and send a new password to the e-mail, specified during registration.<br>
The user has a personal account, in which he can view and change his data. Also, he can change the password and delete the account.<br>
After entering the site, the client can view a list of films and shows, order the ticket (tickets). If there are no free places, the purchase opportunity is blocked. Payment is made by credit card. After payment, the ticket is sent to the e-mail, specified at registration. The client has the ability to view a list of his orders.<br>
When viewing a list of films, you can search by genre, country, year, age restrictions.<br>
When viewing shows, you can search by cinemas and show date.<br>
When adding or editing a film or a show, the manager or administrator uses the same categories, as well as the ticket cost, and the number of seats. Also, the
 film or the show can be deleted.
